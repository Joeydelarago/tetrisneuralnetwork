## Neural Network
It is a double deul neural network using the pytorch framework. It uses experience relpay to reduce the effect of time and order on the estimation of the inputs. 

## Tetris
Tetris is made in pygame and I've replicated aspects of the openai gym api for game to make it function similarly to one of gyms environments. 
There is only one level and no speed up because speed make little difference to the ai.
